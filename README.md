# shellbee üêöüêù
A collection of shell utility functions written by a noob in shell scripting. These are tested on Ubuntu 20.04. 

## Purpose
These were written by me when automating a big ass setup. This was my first time ever doing bash scripting and thus the noob thing. Obviously, I took help from StackOverflow as well. These functions came in handy at many places in the whole workflow. Also, there are many ways to implement what these functions provide. Truth be told, there might be many native commands too which can replace or shorten some of the implementations but I decided it's better to have them saved on the Internet for my benefit. 

**Note** - The name of functions might feel verbose to people who know the underlying short native commands well. I personally like function names which can give subtle hints of what they are trying to achieve.

## Functions
In the conditional functions I have chosen to return `"true"` or `"false"` since I like this pattern of comparing function outputs to booleans/boolean strings for further decisions. You can totally customize this as per your preferences.
